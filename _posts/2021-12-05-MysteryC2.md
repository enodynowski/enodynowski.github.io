# Mystery C2

This challenge provides us with an IPv4 address and port number. It also indicates that there is a C2 server running on at this IP. It also mentions that there's only 10 attempts, so you can't just guess all the possible open-source C2 frameworks and hope for the best. 

The first thing that I did was run an nmap scap on the IP, to see if I could gather any more information on the service running on port 1337.

The scan indicates that there is a Golang http server running on the given port. I then did some googling, looking to see if I could find some indentifying features of various C2 frameworks. This led me to the website https://www.thec2matrix.com/. Their C2 matrix spreadsheet offers comparisons of a variety of different frameworks, as well as JARM signatures, and other characteristics.

Searching the spreadsheet for "golang" which we identified from the nmap scan, reveals only 2 possible C2 frameworks. Either Brute Ratel or DeimosC2. 

Testing both, the flag was: 
> MetaCTF{DeimosC2}
